# floodingSim
This project aims to explore and process the datasets from the government api and produce a flooding simulation, using jMonkeyEngine, and visualization tool, using OpenStreetMap. This project will mainly consider the flooding caused by heavy rainfall and will incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions to understand the risk of flooding in local area. This will allow the user to see generally the risk of flooding and how the flooding effects the area.

To use, download and import into a Java IDE and then run the class MainMenu.java.
